"Non-Standard Deviations," presents a series of notes, resources, essays, thoughts, and data analysis scripts. 

This work is intended for researchers and students across social sciences who seek a more nuanced understanding of the complexities inherent in empirical inquiry. It is not a procedural manual, but rather an exploration of the conceptual and methodological challenges associated with quantifying and interpreting data. Embracing a messy and uncertain approach, "Non-Standard Deviations" will be developed in a nonlinear way, and it is unlikely that it will even be completed. 



More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.

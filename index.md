"Non-Standard Deviations," presents a series of notes, resources, essays, thoughts, and data analysis scripts. 

This work is intended for researchers and students across social sciences who seek a more nuanced understanding of the complexities inherent in empirical inquiry. It is not a procedural manual, but rather an exploration of the conceptual and methodological challenges associated with quantifying and interpreting data. Embracing a messy and uncertain approach, "Non-Standard Deviations" will be developed in a nonlinear way, and it is unlikely that it will even be completed.
